# TLBot
A python webbot based bot to update random qoutes to a TalkLife account.

Adds random posts and comments to TL. A lot to work on.
gen generates random words using markov chain. sentences are generated using essential-generators.

Apparently TL had me banned for making the bot post random crap. I have to work on a better sentence generator and unlink the account from my main device.

Future improvements:
- If the Captcha cracker works, I maybe able to create a Python API for TalktoTranformer.com, of course with Adam King's permission.
- Chatty Markov seems interesting. I might have to do something to make the generator persistent.
- essential-generators is just as bad as my own gen.py
